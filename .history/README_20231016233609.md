# Foodx: Predicting Orders Using RandomForest Modeling

In the booming food truck scene of Indiana, FoodX stands out as a franchise that aims to revolutionize the way orders are placed. Using historical data from customers, this project seeks to predict what a customer might order based on their basic information, making the ordering process seamless and interactive.

## Project Overview

FoodX is an initiative to amplify the food truck scene in Indiana, with an exciting promotion targeting college students. In the FoodX app, students input basic information about their college experience, and the app predicts their order. If the prediction is wrong, they get a 10% discount. This model aims to improve the accuracy of these predictions and reduce the workload on the staff.

## Repository Contents

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset for training and testing the model.
- `data_modeling_foodx.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-`food_prediction_model.ipynb`: Pickled RandomForest model for predicting orders.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all the necessary packages to run the notebooks.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation & Setup

Follow the [Installation & Setup](#installation--setup) steps from the previous README.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before diving into modeling, an in-depth EDA was performed to understand the data's distributions and potential biases. Visualizations and findings from this stage can be found in the `notebook.ipynb`.

## Ethical and Technical Considerations

Detailed considerations regarding the implications of data collection, storage, and biases are addressed in the `notebook.ipynb`. It covers:

- Ethical implications
- Business outcome implications
- Technical implications

## Model Development

RandomForest was chosen as the modeling technique due to its ability to handle categorical data and its ensemble nature, which generally provides more accurate results. The model training, data preparation, and evaluation process is documented in the `notebook.ipynb`.

## Considerations for Deployment

Given the work and performance of the solution, there are certain considerations to be made before deploying this solution at scale. These considerations include the model's accuracy, computational efficiency, and potential biases that could impact its predictions.
